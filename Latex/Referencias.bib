abstract = {The present research introduces an evolutionary algorithm able to procedurally generate dungeon maps containing locked door missions. The evolutionary algorithm evolves a tree structure, which encodes dungeons, aiming to generate levels close to the input configuration provided by a game designer. The tree structure holds information about the number of rooms, connections between them, and their position within a 2D map. The proposed encoding also allows evolving semantic information about the narrative of the game. This is done by feasibly setting keys and locks throughout the dungeons for locked door missions. The generated dungeons are then evaluated computationally and as a proof of concept using an adventure game prototype. A total of 70 players evaluated the contents and the results show that the procedurally generated levels are perceived as more human-made, fun, and difficult than their human-made counterparts for most cases.}

abstract = {This paper presents a two-step generative approach for creating dungeons in the rogue-like puzzle game MiniDungeons 2. Generation is split into two steps, initially producing the architectural layout of the level as its walls and floor tiles, and then furnishing it with game objects representing the player's start and goal position, challenges and rewards. Three layout creators and three furnishers are introduced in this paper, which can be combined in different ways in the two-step generative process for producing diverse dungeons levels. Layout creators generate the floors and walls of a level, while furnishers populate it with monsters, traps, and treasures. We test the generated levels on several expressivity measures, and in simulations with procedural persona agents.},
